								We use cookies and similar technologies across our websites to improve their performance and enhance your user 
								experience. In accordance with a new EU law that came into effect in May 2012, this policy explains the way in

							<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
							<p>
								Like most websites, our server gathers limited information about you during a session, including the IP address 
								and domain name from which you are accessing the server and your browser configuration. This information is only 
								used to help us improve the content, design and performance of the site, and is not linked to the identity of any 
								individual user.
							</p>
							<p>
								Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you do not log out using the “log out” button and 
								close your browser, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, 
								and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user’s general 
								location.
							</p>
							<p>
								Cookies are small pieces of information that are transferred to and stored by your browser on your computer. In no 
								circumstances do we collect any data that is not directly related to the use of the website (for example, we do not 
								record other sites that you have visited). The log files or any information they contain about your use of the site 
								will not be made available to any third parties other than as anonymous usage statistics.

							<h2>Session cookies</h2>
							<p>
								We use session cookies to keep you logged in while you move through pages and services on our site, to enable you to 
								complete transactions on the site and, for example, to pre-populate forms with information to save you typing in 
								information that you have already provided. Session cookies have a short lifetime and will be deleted from your 
								computer when you close your browser or log out of your account.

							<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
							<p>
								We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. This analysis shows us which areas of the site are 
								popular and those that are not often visited which helps us to use our website resources in the most effective way. 
								The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. 
								Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank">www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a>.
